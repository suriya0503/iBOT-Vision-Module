YOLO is an abbreviation for the term ‘You Only Look Once’. This is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects. Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images. The YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects. The CNN is used to predict various class probabilities and bounding boxes simultaneously.

Yolo uses a pre-trained dataset called COCO which has 80 pretrained classes including person, bicycle,etc.
